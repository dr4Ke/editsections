/*
Makes the default template display much better with this plugin.
If using other templates, you may want to make your own adjustments.

This moves the section edit button down onto the same "line" as the header 
that it belongs to.

Note: Adding the 'body' selector makes these rules more specific, and so 
ensures that they will augment DokuWiki's 'secedit' css rules. You should 
be able to override this by adding the 'html' selector to the 'secedit' css 
rules in your template.
